Hi my name is Queen Ugochinyere Alu  (Enya AkpuruenyaChukwu)
I am a Senior Registrar in the Internal Medicine Department of Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki where I am pursuing a cardiology specialization. I have practiced medicine in Nigeria for about seven years, and one thing that has struck me is the strain that the dearth of primary healthcare puts on patients. I often listen to clinic patients recount the distance they have traveled and bargain for longer appointment intervals. This encouraged me to work on a project that maximizes each patient's clinic visit. This book contains some of the things I wish my patients brought along as they come to the clinic.
Additionally, I have seen patients lose critical medical information because they lost their hospital card when this can be prevented by simply having them store their card numbers in their phones. Also, many times patients recall symptoms they had at home when the consultation is over. Many of these problems can be solved by encouraging documentation from patients. I have added some mnemonics I created for health education. I have also added names of sites with helpful and trustworthy information for patients. 
This is more of a framework than a book. The idea is for you to adapt the general ideas it shares to your diary, notes app, or any exercise book. 
I will add updated features to the framework as time passes and these updates will be free as well.
This framework is dedicated to my mum, Sophie Alu who has always inspired me and is my role model. This work is also dedicated to my family and to all patients I have met in practice.

I am open to feedback about this work, what do you think I should add, email me at cliniqcompanion@gmail.com
